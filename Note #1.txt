int a=2, b=4, c=0;
c=a, b=c;

//c=a,b=c; valid, b and c value will be 0 after this statement. In the right hand side,
two statements are grouped using comma. So execution will be from left to right. So 
first'a' will be executed, but only a is no meaning, so then b=c will be executed, and 
thenright most result, b is assigned to c(c=b).




//CONTINUE:
if executed, passes the control to the starting of the loop by skipping the statements below it.

usage:

for (i=1;i<=20;i++)
{
	if(i%3==0)
		continue;
	printf("%d",i);
}






//PRINT()


#include<stdio.h>

{
     int a=10,b=20;
     print(a=b,a==b);            //(a==b)--->0 will be passed first, then (a=b)--->20 will be passed.
